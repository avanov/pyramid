Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

 - Following the Pyramid deprecation period (1.6 -> 1.8),
   daemon support for pserve has been removed. This includes removing the
   daemon commands (start, stop, restart, status) as well as the following
   arguments:
   --daemon --pid-file --log-file --monitor-restart --status --user --group
   --stop-daemon

   To run your server as a daemon you should use a process manager instead of
   pserve.
